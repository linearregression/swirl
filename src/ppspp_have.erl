%%-spec ... handle takes a tuple of {type, message_body} where body is a
%%    parsed orddict message and returns either
%%    {error, something} or tagged tuple for the unpacked message
%%    {ok, reply} where reply is probably an orddict to be sent to the
%%    alternate peer.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The payload of the have message is a channel ID (see
%  Section 3.11) and a sequence of protocol options.  Example options
%  are the content integrity protection scheme used and an option to
%  specify the swarm identifier.  The complete set of protocol options
%  are specified in Section 7.
