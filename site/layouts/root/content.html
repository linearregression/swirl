        server &amp clients provide world-class reliability,
        using the legendary availability and low latency performance

        <p>Be first with the news. No need to wait for a broadcast or event
        to end, swirl lets you stream the moment you have the first frames
        on camera.  But if you're late to the party, don't worry, you
        won't have missed a thing. Swirl is ready to kick off when you
        are &mdash; just pick up where you left off, on any device.</p>

        <p>Unlike all those other tools, Swirl is both
        <a href="{{ .Site.Params.github }}">open source</a> and
        <a href="{{ .Site.Params.github }}/issues">open development</a>,
        built on an open standard, with peer-to-peer scalability and
        fault-tolerance baked in from the beginning.</p>
        <p>The application is based on the 
          <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ppsp-peer-protocol/">
           IETF draft Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol</a>, known as
           <em>PPSP</em> normally. The protocol includes innovative
           features for fast streaming, security and performance, and is
           compatible with current network infrastructure without
           rearchitecting or forklift upgrades.
