Swirl want to make sharing and streaming as easy as taking a picture.

## Broadcast Reliably

Whether you're streaming a birthday or celebration from your phone, hosting the
Olympics, or running a pay-per-view event, swirl has you covered. Its new,
non-proprietary live streaming server & clients provide world-class reliability,
using the legendary availability and low latency performance built into the
Erlang/OTP platform.

## Start streaming now — or later

Be first with the news. No need to wait for a broadcast or event to end, swirl
lets you stream the moment you have the first frames on camera. But if you're
late to the party, don't worry, you won't have missed a thing. Swirl is ready to
kick off when you are — just pick up where you left off, on any device.

## Open & standard

Unlike all those other tools, Swirl is both open source and open development,
built on an open standard, with peer-to-peer scalability and fault-tolerance
baked in from the beginning.

The application is based on the IETF draft Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol,
known as PPSP normally. The protocol includes innovative features for fast
streaming, security and performance, and is compatible with current network
infrastructure without rearchitecting or forklift upgrades.

## More Information

The menu on this page includes a link to the various components of Swirl.
You will find it easiest to read them in order, at least initially, starting
off with the [implementation]({{< relref "implementation.md" >}}) guide.
